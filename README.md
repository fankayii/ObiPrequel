# My Personal Project


## About the Project
This is a side-scrolling game that tells an alternative <b><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></b> story. (Yes, I blame Disney for this.) 
In the game, the player will be able to control Obi-Wan 
and go through couples of stages to find Qui-Gon Jinn while fighting with enemies from *Prequel Triology*.
## Background
I became interested in **Star Wars** after playing *Lego: Skywalker Saga* last year with my friends. 
The idea of creating a little game emerged as soon as I knew we need to build an application for CPSC 210.
After playing SW-related games like <em>Battlefront II</em> and <em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, 
I came to realise that there should be more about the pre-Empire era stuff. 

In addition to this, from a certain point of view, making a game would require deeper 
understanding of OOP and GUI, which is what I hope to.

### Goals of the Project

I won't say this is a self-indulgent game, but instead seeing it as a fun way to take a break
from school. The game is aimed to entertain the audience by providing an interesting plot.
 
### Targeted Users

- SW fans, or anyone that has interest in SW : )

## User Stories
### Phase 1
- As a user, I want to be able to move around and see where I am
- As a user, I want to be able to progress to the next stage 
- As a user, I want to be able to add an item to my inventory and use it later
- As a user, I want to be able to see my stats so I can make my next move accordingly

### Phase 2
- As a user, I want to be able to save the game progress to file (if I choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to load the game progress from file (if I choose)\


## Code reference
